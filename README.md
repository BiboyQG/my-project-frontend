# React + Vite

About this repo:

This is my personal project frontend repo using React + React Router + React Toastify + Framer Motion + React Icons + Axios + TailwindCSS + Sass + NextUI flow.

You can use:

```
npm -i
```

or:

```
yarn
```

to install all the dependencies and start the frontend by:

```
yarn cssb
```

to build the CSS file generated by TailwindCSS and then:

```
yarn dev
```

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
